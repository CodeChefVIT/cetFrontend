## What is Common Entry Test ?
Common Entry Test is an assistive technology that helps make applying to clubs and chapters in VIT much easier and hassle free.

## Why Common Entry Test ?

4. Save time by reducing the time you spend on tedious recruitment tests by giving just one standardised test and spend it with your friends and enjoy college life.
5. Give a custom test by a club, team or chapter.
6. As an organisation, you don't need to spend resources and time trying to make your own portal. We do it for you.
